## Molecule representation

[S. Raghunathan, U. D. Priyakumar, Int. J. Quantum Chem. 2022, 122(7), e26870](https://doi.org/10.1002/qua.26870).

There are three key invariance of physical systems those are preferably captured by a common molecular descriptor. Formally, these are as follows:

1.   Rotational invariance: Representation must by invariant upon a rotation operation.
2.   Translational invariance: Representation must by unchanged upon a translation in space.
3.   Permutation invariance: Representation must by unaltered due to the change in the particular order of the atoms.
